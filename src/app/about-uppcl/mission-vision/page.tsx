                        The goal of the Uttar Pradesh Power Sector Reform programme is to:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Provide cost efficient good quality electricity to all categories of
                            consumers for economic development/social uplift of the State.

                        <li>

                    <li>Keeping in view the above mentioned goals, the Government of Uttar Pradesh has agreed on the following key aspects of the Power Sector Reform Programme:</li>

                        <li>Restructing of Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board (UPSEB) into autonomous and separately accountable entities.</li>
